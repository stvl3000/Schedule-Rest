# Schedule-Rest
Do you often set a time alarm to reminder yourself to stop hard work, playing games, watching movies when time flyed quietly? If yes, this is not necessary for you. If NOOOOOOO, I hope this little 30KB application may help sometimes.
This Schedule Rest application helps schedule shutdown / hibernate / sleep computer on time, comes with System tray icon. This is my first Windows application. Apology for the uggly first beta Revision 0.1. This one got some improvement. Compare with Beta Revision 0.1, This Revision had following optimizations:
  1. Made a better looking.
  2. Got another language added in, now supports Simplified Chinese.
  3. Tested on Windows 10 PC and Windows 7. However, some version of Windows 10 on pad does not support both Suspend and Hibernate mode, hereby only Shutdown mode supported on pad version of Windows 10.
